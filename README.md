This is a Laravel-based web application designed to showcase my ability to develop dynamic and scalable web applications. It features an advanced user authentication system, real-time data processing.

## Technologies Used:
- Laravel 10
- PHP 
- MySQL
- JavaScript 
- Ajax
- Bootstrap 5
- Git/GitHub


## Features:
- User registration and login, verification,reset password (with Laravel authentication)
- Real-time notifications 
- Dynamic data visualization with charts
- job posting, application tracking,chat-system 


## To get started:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Eza51/project-01.git`
2. Install dependencies: `composer install`
3. Set up your environment variables: Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
4. Run migrations (if needed): `php artisan migrate`
5. Serve the application: `php artisan serve`

## Known Limitations:
- The database connection is not set up in the current version. Please configure `.env` for full functionality.
- Some features such as email notifications (e.g., user registration and password reset emails) are disabled 
  in this demo version.
- Currently, the front-end interface is a work-in-progress.

## Personal Reflection:
Building this Laravel project was an excellent opportunity for me to deepen my understanding of modern web development practices, including RESTful API integration, real-time communication, and Laravel's Eloquent ORM. I faced challenges related to managing database migrations and user authentication, but I successfully overcame them by researching solutions and experimenting with different approaches. This project has significantly enhanced my problem-solving and technical documentation skills.
Collaboration:
This project was a collaboration between multiple developers. I worked alongside talented team members who contributed to various aspects of the application. Iâ€™d like to acknowledge their efforts in making this project a success.
